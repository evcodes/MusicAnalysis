### Final Decisions:
- kNN (Sentiment Analysis, Gender) -> using sentiment analysis to predict gender
- DecisionTree((SA), MusicalProperties, G) -> sentiment analysis and Musical properties to predict gender

### Checkpoint:

We have managed to gather lyrics from lyric wikia and we have also gathered a dataset of over 25k artists gender from kaggle. We scraped wikipedia data to get artist's gender.

We have built out a sentiment analysis tool that tokenizes song lyrics and outputs a list of sentiments out of 100%.

We are in build a database of songs with their songID, song, artist name, artist gender, SA score of the lyrics (Neutral, Happy, Sadness, Anger, Hate)
