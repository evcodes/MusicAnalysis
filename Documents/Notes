Mode is whether the song uses a major or a minor key in its production. Though this value is straightforward with a 0 for minor and a 1 for major, there was also a value named mode_confidence that depicted the probability of the mode selected being accurate. With these two values, we combined the features to range from -1 for minor to 1 for major. A value of -1 represents 100% confidence that the key is minor and 1 represents 100% confidence that the key is major. The range of confidences for minor lie between -1 and 0 and the range of confidences for major lie between 0 and 1.
